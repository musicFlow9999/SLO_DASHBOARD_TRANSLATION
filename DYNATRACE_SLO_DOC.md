## Introduction

Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) represent a proven way to ensure your system's health and performance for end-users. They serve as simplified gauges for achieving mid to long-term targets and are critical for maintaining the stability and reliability of IT services. Dynatrace provides comprehensive SLO capabilities that help define and measure expected performance levels for services and applications.

### Why SLOs Matter

- **Improve Software Quality**: Define acceptable levels of downtime and identify issues before they become incidents
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use performance data to make informed decisions about releases and resource allocation
- **Promote Automation**: Enable automated monitoring, alerting, and quality gates throughout the SDLC
- **Balance Innovation and Reliability**: Use error budgets to find the right balance between new features and system stability

   - Flexible querying across logs, metrics, traces, and events
   - Custom SLI definitions based on any data type

3. **Enhanced User Interface**
   - Improved SLO wizard with template selection
   - Segment selector for filtering entities and DQL queries
   - Better visualization of SLO status and error budgets

4. **Advanced Alerting**
   - Dedicated and tailored burn-rate alerts for proactive notification of performance degradation
   - Configurable alert thresholds and notification channels
   - Integration with metric events

## Core Concepts

### Service-Level Indicator (SLI)
A quantitative measure of some aspect of a system's service level. SLIs are normalized time series expressed as percentages between 0-100%, where 100% represents perfect performance.

**Examples:**
- Service success rate (percentage of successful requests)
- Response time (percentage of requests under a threshold)
- Availability (uptime percentage)
- Custom metrics based on logs or events

### Service-Level Objective (SLO)
The target value for an SLI over a specific evaluation period. For example:
- 99.9% of service calls must succeed over a 7-day period
- 95% of requests must complete within 500ms over a 30-day period

### Service-Level Agreement (SLA)
A contractual agreement between a service provider and customer that includes one or more SLOs, often with financial consequences for violations.

### Error Budget
The difference between the SLO status and SLO threshold. Working with error budgets allows an improved approach to monitoring and ensuring the system's health and serves as a quality gate for new deployments.

## Creating SLOs

### Accessing the SLO Module

1. In Dynatrace, search for **Service-Level Objectives** and open the app
2. Select **Service-level objective** from the navigation
3. Choose between template-based or custom SLO creation

### SLO Creation Workflow

The SLO creation process involves selecting entities, defining criteria, and configuring the SLO parameters through a guided wizard.

#### Step 1: Choose Creation Method
- **Template-based**: Use pre-configured templates for common use cases
- **Custom DQL**: Define custom SLIs using DQL queries

#### Step 2: Select Entities
- Choose services, applications, or synthetic monitors
- Apply segment filters to narrow down selections
- Configure entity-specific parameters

#### Step 3: Define Criteria
- Set target percentage (e.g., 99.9%)
- Configure evaluation period (e.g., 7 days, 30 days)
- Add optional warning thresholds

#### Step 4: Name and Context
- Provide descriptive name
- Add description for documentation
- Apply tags for organization

---

## SLO Templates

Dynatrace provides several out-of-the-box templates for common SLO scenarios:

### 1. Service Availability
Measures the percentage of successful service calls:
```
Target: Total successful calls / Total calls ≥ 99.9%
```

### 2. Service Performance
Monitors response time performance:
```
Target: Requests faster than X milliseconds ≥ 95%
```

### 3. Web Application Performance
Tracks web application metrics:
- Page load times
- JavaScript errors
- User action duration

### 4. Mobile App Availability
Monitors mobile application health:
- Crash-free sessions
- Network request success rates
- App startup time

### 5. Synthetic Availability
Tracks synthetic monitoring results:
- Synthetic test success rate
- Availability from different locations

## Custom SLOs with DQL

Custom SLOs allow you to define SLIs based on DQL queries, which must include an "sli" field that returns an array of double type values.

### Basic DQL SLO Structure

```dql
timeseries {
  total = sum(dt.service.request.count),
  failures = sum(dt.service.request.failure_count)
}
| fieldsAdd sli = (total - failures) / total * 100
```

### Advanced Examples

#### Log-based SLO
This SLI measures the proportion of log lines with loglevels INFO and WARNING against all log lines:
```dql
fetch logs
| summarize {
    total = count(),
    good = countIf(loglevel IN ["INFO", "WARNING"])
  }
| fieldsAdd sli = good / total * 100
```

#### Latency-based SLO
This SLI measures the duration of service requests based on spans:
```dql
fetch spans
| filter span.kind == "server"
| makeTimeseries {
    total = count(),
    good = countIf(duration <= 150ms)
  }, by:{name = entityName(dt.entity.service)}
| fieldsAdd sli = good / total * 100
```

#### Custom Business Metric SLO
```dql
fetch bizevents
| filter event.type == "purchase.completed"
| makeTimeseries {
    successful_purchases = countIf(status == "success"),
    total_purchases = count()
  }
| fieldsAdd sli = successful_purchases / total_purchases * 100
```

## Error Budgets and Burn Rates

### Error Budget Calculation

Error budget burn rate represents the short-term consumption rate of the currently available SLO error budget. A high burn rate depicts an abnormally high consumption of the error budget relative to the SLO evaluation period.

**Formula:**
```
Error Budget = 100% - SLO Target
Remaining Error Budget = SLO Status - SLO Target
```

**Example:**
- SLO Target: 99.5%
- Current Status: 99.7%
- Error Budget: 0.5%
- Remaining: 0.2%

### Burn Rate Monitoring

Burn rate alerts help identify when error budget is being consumed too quickly:

1. **Fast Burn (Critical)**
   - Threshold: 10x normal rate
   - Window: 1 hour
   - Action: Immediate investigation

2. **Slow Burn (Warning)**
   - Threshold: 2x normal rate
   - Window: 6 hours
   - Action: Scheduled review

### Creating Burn Rate Alerts

1. Navigate to your SLO
2. Select **More (...) > Create alert**
3. Choose **Burn rate** as alert type
4. Configure thresholds and notifications
